Java-Lessons Material

Because we forgot it in the lesson our names are Max, Leo and Alex

We want You to bring your own computer to this course ... if it's possible. It's way more fun to code and we don't have enough workingplaces there.

Please install an IDE on your system! We recommand IntelliJ, which is free for all students!  
Also notable is eclipse.

Please read the slide from the first lesson if you got any other questions.

## UPDATE
From now on all material can be found at [http://fsr.github.io/java-lessons/](http://fsr.github.io/java-lessons/)

This repository hosts `code` _only_
